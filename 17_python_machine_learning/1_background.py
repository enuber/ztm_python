# get computers to act without asking them to do something.
# data science - analyize data looking at it to do something with it for business purposes
# data science overlaps AI, Machine Learning and deep learning. Without data science you can't do or have the other

# Machine learning
# teaching a computer what something is or how to interpret what it is given.
# idea is give it the input and what the output should be. Tell it what the answer is. The machine figures out what the function is though.
# traditionally we give it the input, the function and it does the output for us.
# machine learning creates the function also known as a model.

# supervised - data already has categories. like a csv file, can do classification like is this an apple or a pear. Or regression predicting stock prices as an example.

# unsupervised - no labels, like a csv without column names. Clustering, where we give it data and the computer decides what is a group. Or assoication rule learning, like maybe if a customer like this and that they would buy this new thing.

# reinforcement - teaching through trial and error. Like playing a game over and over until it gets the high score because it learns to play after millions of tries.
