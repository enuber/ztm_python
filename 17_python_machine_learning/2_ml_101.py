# 1 - import the data
# 2 - clean the data
# 3 - split the data. training set and a test set. ex: 100 row file, we uses 80 rows for training set and the last 20 rows as the test set.
# 4 - create a model. import an algorithm not really writing it ourselves. we choose who what type to use
# 5 - check the output
# 6 - improve. may give it extra input, or change the model

# data is the hardest part of this. Getting enough data, need a big company that has a lot of data to actually do machine learning.

# TOOLS IN ML
# numpy - helps us use lists and arrays, multi-demsion arrays (lists, arrays)
# pandas - python data analysis library. can manipulate data in a tabular structure. (csv files)
# scikit-learn - algorithm library. to create the model
# matplotlib - another library, it is a charting library to help visualize the data.
# jupyter notebooks - can step through code little by little with visualizations, so can step through each stage and have notebooks that are like a story of each step.
# kaggle - has datasets that we can use for ML.

# need free account on kaggle and jupyter notebooks to get started.

# juptyer notebooks
# hit shift enter to run the code instead of always hitting the play/run button
# can switch code to markup to leave notes in the notebook rather than always writing code.
