# if __name__ == '__main__':

# if we print(__name__) we will get the name of the file it is in.

# main becomes the name of the file we are running. So when we run python3 main.py __main__ is the main.py file. If we ran python3 utility.py __main__ would be utility.py

# can use this for set up as well. like call a setup()  and do stuff or just do it from this area.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('please run this')
