# using main.py and utility.py

#  How do you stay organized when you have many .py files

# Modules...each .py file is a module in itself. So you can divide up your code and organized it by what it does.

# when you run main.py after importing in utility, a __pycache__ gets created so now when you run it again, it looks in there unless something in utility has changed. So it makes it faster to run again. main.py does not get put into that cache and, this folder is not something you need to touch.

# can import as many files as you want and they can be imported into different modules.
