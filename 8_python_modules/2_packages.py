# using shopping folder and file shopping_cart and adding stuff into main.py


# package is a folder containing modules. So a package can have multiple modules. to import you use shopping.shopping_cart to get access to it.

# with packages, inside the folder there is an __init__.py file that is necessary. (vscode does this behind the scenes for us so we don't see it.) Since vscode abstracts this, if we need it, we can define it and put some initialization in it. This file can be left empty.
