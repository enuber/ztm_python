FROM BUILD A PORTFOLIO PART 8

Python anywhere host our web files on a server for free

https://www.pythonanywhere.com/

create an account.

when you load files, you don't need to include everything. for our example would load .csv, .py, static folder, template folder, and requirements.txt. And as python anywhere connects via git, you would load those files into github.

setting up flask applications on pythonganywhere...link below

https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Flask/

under CODE:

sourc code, put folder name of site and it will create the change like /home/erik/portfolio just need to enter portfolio

Setting up your virtualenv
look in this on the link above and follow along

Setting up the Web app using Manual configuration
look in this as well and follow along

gist of this one is that you copy the environment name you gave and go to the web tab in pythonanywhere and past just the environment name into the virtual environment box. It will do the full path itself.


Then go to below area for PORTILIO PART 9


 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NOTE for future projects requirements.txt

this freeze caputres the packages installed in the current environment, which is our virtual environment. So we can run our app in different environments and machines.

pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

will give you a requirements.txt file that gives you a list of dependencies that can be used on another project.

then can use 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
to install the requirements dependencies

Portfolio part 9

go to WSGI config file

as using flask, can get rid of all text that doesn't include +++++ Flask+++++++

uncomment the following 
import sys
path = '/home/erik/portfolio' # needs to be path to your project
if path not in sys.path:
  sys.path.append(path)

# the from needs to be the file where we are serving our files from in server.py we do app = Flask(__name__) which says this is the app and how we know what file we want to put in the from
from server.py import app as application

then save 

click on big green button at top of page to reload the page and the site is now live
